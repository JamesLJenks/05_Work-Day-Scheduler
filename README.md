# 05_Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description

The objective for this project was to create a simple calendar application that would allow a user to save events for each hour of the work day. The required functionality included providing the ability to input event information and store it in the web browser so that it would be available upon refresh. In addition, business hours were expected to be color coded to represent which times were in the past, present, and future. The application features dynamically updated HTML and CSS using jQuery and the Moment.js library. The framework for the site was built using Bootstrap.
